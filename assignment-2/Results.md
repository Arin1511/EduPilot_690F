In our experiments, both FedAvg and FedMedian achieved similar accuracy under IID data, since all clients contributed updates aligned toward the global optimum. However, under Non-IID data, FedAvg remained robust with 0.7425 accuracy, while FedMedian collapsed to 0.3175. This is consistent with prior work: FedAvg averages client updates and smooths out heterogeneity, whereas FedMedian—designed for adversarial robustness—relies on majority agreement. In heterogeneous settings, where client updates diverge, the median can cancel out useful gradients, leading to poor convergence.
